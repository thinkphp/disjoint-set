## Disjoint-set Forests Data Structure

In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union-find data structure or merge-find set, is a data structure
that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets. It supports two useful operations:

* Find  - Determine which subset a particular elements is in.

* Union - Join two subsets into a single subset.
